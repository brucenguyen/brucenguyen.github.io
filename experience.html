				<h3>Java Software Developer <i>- Jan 2020 - Apr 2020</i></h3>
				<h4>North York, Ontario, Canada</h4>
				<figcaption class="portfolio-item-desc">
					<p>As a member of the development team at SQL Power, I was responsible for improving and expanding the 
					functionality of in-house tools that are being used to develop business returns under XBRL standards. As 
					part of my work, several areas of the product received significant performance improvements as a result 
					of optimizations of existing algorithms and refactoring existing code. Responding to client requirements, 
					new features were added and existing features were modified, which meant that I was also responsible for 
					some database upgrades using Liquibase, SQL, and JDBC. As part of the changes I made, I would create
					JUnit test cases to ensure the issues do not recur. Unfortunately, a portion of this term was affected 
					by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

				<h3>Software QA Analyst <i>- May 2019 - Aug 2019</i></h3>
				<h4>North York, Ontario, Canada</h4>
				<figcaption class="portfolio-item-desc">
					<p>During my time as a Software QA Analyst at SQL Power, I was responsible for manual and automated testing
					of various software products, particularly web applications, that were in development. The manual testing 
					involved thoroughly using and stress testing the software in order to find issues that must be solved 
					before production release. For automated testing, we used Katalon Studio. Using Katalon, I built test
					cases with Groovy/Java which allowed us to test parts of the application much more quickly as opposed to
					manual testing. As part of building these test cases in Katalon, I frequently used CSS and XPath.
					In addition to automated web testing, I performed stress testing of these applications using Apache JMeter.</p>

				<h3>Systems Officer <i>- Sep 2018 - Dec 2018</i></h3>
				<h4>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</h4>
				<figcaption class="portfolio-item-desc">
					<p>In this Technology Services position, I was one of the primary support technicians for the Office of
					the Public Guardian and Trustee (OPGT). During my term here, my primary project was an office-wide migration
					from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I was responsible for migrating over 20% of all computers in the Toronto office, 
					and several others at the Hamilton office. As a result of this project, I created several batch files and PowerShell 
					scripts in order to automate several areas of the migration process. In addition to the migration project, I maintained
					server back-ups using Backup Exec and HP Data Protector. My other responsibilities included ticket management and 
					resolving technology-related issues in all the OPGT offices.</p>

					<p>During my time at AGF Management, I acted as a systems administrator for AGF's Toronto office. My primary
					responsibility was to manage the incident queue and resolve tickets as they arose. During this term, the 
					Technology Services department was working on overhauling the software deployment system. As a result, I worked 
					with Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to test software packages and deploy them to workstations as 
					required. Occasionally, I was responsible for managing groups and creating new users in Active Directory.</p>
