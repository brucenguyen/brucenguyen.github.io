					<h1>About</h1>
					<hr><br>
					<p>
						Hi, my name is Bruce, just like it says right above, and I am a computer engineering 
						student at the University of Waterloo.<br><br>

						I enjoy the process of learning and very guilty of taking on too many challenges. 
						However, I do not give up easily and work tirelessly to overcome rough patches. Over 
						the past year, I built a <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> of software projects in 
						various environments to educate myself on different areas of software development.<br><br>

						A lot of my passion is in art, and I recently began to think about how art is also 
						deeply connected with my passion of engineering. I have worked on several art pieces 
						with physical media and also have worked on many graphics design projects. My passion in 
						art leads me into my interest in films. Most recently, I have worked with some of my 
						close friends on a series of experimental 
						<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9865444" target="_blank">films</a>.
