					<h1>About</h1>
					<hr><br>
					<p>
						Hi, my name is Bruce, just like it says right above, and I am a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br><br>

						I enjoy the process of learning and very guilty of taking on too many challenges. However, I do not give up easily and work tirelessly
						to overcome rough patches. Over the past year, I built a <a href="">portfolio</a> of software projects in various environments to educate myself on
						different areas of software development.<br><br>

						A lot of my passion is in art, and I recently began to think about how art is also deeply connected with my passion of engineering.
						I have worked on several art pieces with physical media and also have worked on many graphics design projects. My passion in art leads me into my 
						interest in films. Most recently, I have worked with some of my close friends on a series of experimental 
						<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9865444">films</a>.
