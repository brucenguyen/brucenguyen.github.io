					<h3>A simple graphing calculator created using Java.</h3>
					<p>Using Java and CSS, I developed a graphing calculator that plots a function in real-time. My objective
					with this project was to learn about event handling and creating GUIs without use of additional tools.</p>

					to expose myself to website development. My objective with this project was to familiarize

					<h3>1st place among over 20 teams.</h3>
					<p>For this event, all teams were tasked to design a robot given a limited amount of supplies.
					This robot would need to completed a specific sequence of tasks in the least amount of time.<br><br>
					
					The robots were evaluated based on how quickly they completed the tasks and the amount of
					engineering ingenuity that went into them. Our team managed to finish with the second-fastest
					time, but had creative electrical and software work. As a result, our team came out on top.</p>

					<p>This assignment emphasized design and simulation before construction. We were to first
					design the bridge using bridge simulation software to identify weak points of the design and
					see if the design is affordable. After that, we were provided with a limited number of supplies
					to build that design. My partner and I won the competition by carrying the most weight before
					failure.</p>

					<h3>A story in 60 seconds.</h3>
					<p>Shortly after committing armed robbery, a group of teenagers flee the scene. However, this 
					time of anxiety and panic shows the groups true colours.<br><br>

					No Way Out is a short, one minute film I produced with several good friends. This film was written 
					by myself and Gabriel Moreira. The cinematography and editing is by Richard Nguyen. 
					I was also responsible for the intro logo and animation which were created in After Effects.</p>

					<h3>Black holes in simple words.</h3>
					<p>I produced a film for my final project in 12th grade physics. The educational film talks about what

					The writing and filming was completed by my colleagues, while I was responsible for post-production. 
					All editing was completed entirely using Adobe After Effects in under 3 hours.</p>
